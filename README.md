typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```

### Compilation
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

### The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.


### Tasks

#### 0. push, pall

Implement the `push` and `pall` opcodes.

##### Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18. Stack (LIFO) & queue (FIFO)$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18. Stack (LIFO) & queue (FIFO)$
```

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

```
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18. Stack (LIFO) & queue (FIFO)$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$

```

##### The monty program

1. Usage: `monty file`
    * where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
2. If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print `USAGE: monty file`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
3. If, for any reason, it’s not possible to use read the file, print Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
4. If the file contains an invalid instruction, print `L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
    * Line numbers always start at 1
5. The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if:
    * it executed properly every line of the file
    * or it finds an error in the file
    * or an error occured
6. If you can’t malloc anymore, print `Error: malloc failed`, followed by a new line, and exit with status `EXIT_FAILURE`. You have to use `malloc` and `free` and are not allowed to use any other function from `man malloc`
7. All error messages must be printed on stdout


##### 0. push

The opcode `push` pushes an element to the stack.

1. Usage: `push <int>``
        * where `<int>` is an integer
2. If `<int>` is not an integer or if there is no argument to push, print the message `L<line_number>: usage: push integer`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
3. You don’t have to deal with overflows. Use the `atoi` function

##### The pall opcode

The opcode `pall` prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

1. Usage: `pall`
2. Format: see example
If the stack is empty, don’t print anything

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/00.m
push 1$
push 2$
push 3$
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ ./monty bytecodes/00.m
3
2
1
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$
```

##### 1. pint

The opcode `pint` prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

1. Usage: `pint`
2. If the stack is empty, print `L<line_number>: can't pint, stack empty`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/06.m 
push 1
pint
push 2
pint
push 3
pint
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ ./monty bytecodes/06.m

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ 
```

##### 2. pop

The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

1. Usage: `pop`
2. If the stack is empty, print `L<line_number>: can't pop an empty stack`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/07.m 
push 1
push 2
push 3

##### 3. swap

The opcode `swap` swaps the top two elements of the stack.

1. Usage: `swap`
2. If the stack is less than two element long, print `L<line_number>: can't swap, stack too short`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/09.m 
push 1
push 2

##### 4. add

The opcode `add` adds the top two elements of the stack.

1. Usage: `add`
2. If the stack is less than two element long, print `L<line_number>: can't add, stack too short`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
3. The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        * the top element of the stack contains the result
        * the stack is one element shorter

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/12.m

1. Usage: `nop`

##### 6. sub

The opcode `sub` subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.

1. Usage: `sub`
2. If the stack is less than two element long, print `L<line_number>: can't sub, stack too short`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `EXIT_FAILURE`
3. The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
        * the top element of the stack contains the result
        * the stack is one element shorter

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/19.m

##### 7. div

The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: div
If the stack is less than two element long, print L<line_number>: can't div, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
the top element of the stack contains the result
the stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

##### 8. mul

The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.

Usage: mul
If the stack is less than two element long, print L<line_number>: can't mul, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
the top element of the stack contains the result
the stack is one element shorter

GitHub repository: monty

##### 9. mod

The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.

Usage: mod
If the stack is less than two element long, print L<line_number>: can't mod, stack too short, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
The result is stored in the second top element of the stack, and the top element is removed, so that at the end:
the top element of the stack contains the result
the stack is one element shorter
If the top element of the stack is 0, print L<line_number>: division by zero, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

##### 10. comments

Every good language comes with the capability of commenting. When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don’t do anything).

##### 11. pchar

The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pchar
The integer stored at the top of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
If the value is not in the ascii table (man ascii) print L<line_number>: can't pchar, value out of range, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If the stack is empty, print L<line_number>: can't pchar, stack empty, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE

```
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat bytecodes/28.m 
push 72
pchar
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ ./monty bytecodes/28.m 
H
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$
```

##### 12. pstr

The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

Usage: pstr
The integer stored in each element of the stack is treated as the ascii value of the character to be printed
The string stops where:
the stack is over
the value of the element is 0
the value of the element is not in the ascii table
If the stack is empty, print only a new line

##### 14. The rotr opcode

The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.

Usage: rotr
The last element of the stack becomes the top element of the stack
rotr never fails

##### 15. stack, queue

The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default behavior of the program.

Usage: stack

##### The queue opcode

The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

Usage: queue
When switching mode:

the top of the stack becomes the front of the queue
the front of the queue becomes the top of the stack
